# FizzBuzz
A program that outputs the numbers from 1 to 100. For numbers that are multiples of 3, it returns "number - Fizz". 
For numbers that are multiples of 5, it returns "number - Buzz". 
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "number - FizzBuzz". 
If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, simply print the number itself. 
### Example
__1__  
__2__  
__3 - Fizz__  
__15 - FizzBuzz__
